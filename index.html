              Created in 48 hours for <a href="https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2023">GMTK Game Jam 2023</a> – with the surprise
              theme of Roles Reversed – this was my third time participating in the annual event, but it was the first
              time I was satisfied with the results.
            </p>
            <p class="answer">
              <strong class="question">How?</strong>
              Applying lessons learned from the first two GMTK jams, I found a team early and organized an 8-hour
              practice jam two weeks before the event started. This strategy helped us work through some technical
              issues and perfect our team dynamic, to produce a fun game within the time limit. I was responsible for
              code, testing, and project management. The whole team worked together nicely to invent and develop the
              concept. I’m proud of what we accomplished!

              <strong class="question">Why?</strong>
              As a child, I often dreamed of falling from a high place.
              The moment I reached the ground, I woke up, my head hitting the pillow forcefully.
              The sensation reminds me of the story of Lucifer being cast out of heaven.
              I wrote an
              <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/13sce2jEWFdr9Gt1SskGnmAI_GmUf_NViNB39hJJOFGU">unfinished
                poem</a>
              to capture that feeling, from which I drew inspiration for the game.

              <strong class="question">How?</strong>
              This was my final project for
              <a href="https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/week-4-personal-project-aug-3-aug-7">Create with Code</a>.
              I was in a dark place after getting laid off at the start of the pandemic and I felt trapped.
              I channeled these feelings into the game mechanics.
              At the start, you fall from a great height into a deep well.
              Hitting one of the four walls changes your alignment.
              Seek out the light to increase your strength and escape.

              My friend built a game.
              It was full of typos.
              Rather than complain, I decided to fix them myself.
              Once I got into it, I couldn't help but add some content of my own.

              You, a mere mortal meatbag, face off against the perfect immortal machine
              known as "Supreme" in an epic battle of X's and O's.
              It will require all of your human cunning to find and exploit bugs
              and defeat Supreme at its own game.
